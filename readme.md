This site is dedicated to sharing information on how to categorize lost time and energy following IEC 61400-26-1 (2019).

The initial effort will be to identify a succinct list of level 5 categories, aligned with the standard level 4 categories.

Future work includes methods of implementation. 

While turbine technology and alignment of events with IEC categories is improving, there is almost ALWAYS a need for human intervention, especially regarding site wide events. With these types of events, a written log with start and stop dates and times and descriptions of the event can be invaluable.
